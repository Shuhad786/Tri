    <p id="tribute-info">Wangari Maathai, in full Wangari Muta Maathai, (born April 1, 1940, Nyeri, Kenyaâ€”died September 25, 2011, Nairobi), Kenyan politician and environmental activist who was awarded the 2004 Nobel Prize for Peace, 
      becoming the first Black African woman to win a Nobel Prize. Her work was often considered both unwelcome and subversive in her own country, 
      where her outspokenness constituted stepping far outside traditional gender roles.</p>
